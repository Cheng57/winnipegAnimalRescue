Executive Summary

I propose to build a content management system for "Winnipeg Animal Rescue", a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in the Winnipeg area. The organization requires a web-based CMS to manage and display information about the rescued animals and to allow potential adopters to view and apply for available animals online.

Problem/Opportunity Statement

The organization needs to build a website to provide users with information about the rescued animals and to facilitate potential adopters to apply for available animals online.

Proposed Solution

The CMS will have three types of users:
1.	Visitors: These users will be able to view animal listings and browse available animals.
2.	Adopters: These users will be able to create an account, apply to adopt animals and view their application status.
3.	Administrators: These users will be able to manage animal listings, accept adoption applications, and manage user accounts.

The CMS will have the following four tables:
1.	Animals Table: This table will store information about each animal. It is essential for managing and displaying information about rescued animals on the website.
2.	Users Table: This table will store information about website users.  It is crucial for allowing users to create accounts and apply to adopt animals.
3.	Adoption Applications Table: This table will store information about adoption applications. It is essential for managing adoption applications and for administrators to track the status of each application.
4.	Roles Table: This table will store information about user roles. It is necessary for defining the roles of users and their access levels on the website.
